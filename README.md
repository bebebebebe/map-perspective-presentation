Here are some interesting articles

- On Geographic languages. "Does Your Language Shape How You Think"
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29language-t.html
The quotes on slide 2 come from this article.

- Radiolab episode "Lost and Found", partly on a group of people with amazing navigational skills and a geographic language (using cardinal rather than absolute directions). This is what initially gave me the idea that turned into this project!
